# CoolishHelper

## Introduction
This project will start as a grocerylist or todolist for multiple people. Therefore we need to build an app for mobilephones and a backend to realize communication between the different users. The main purpose of this project is to learn different technologies. After just copying tutorials for the App and Backend I decided to restart this project and fokus on the Google Developer Tutorials for Jetpackpack Compose to get a deeper understanding of what is going on.
